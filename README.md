# systemwide

System-wide audio processing subsystem for SOTF. Captures audio from the OS mixer, processes it through the plugin chain, and outputs to physical audio devices.

## Architecture

For a full component review, state-ownership analysis, and Mermaid use-case
diagrams, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

```text
macOS Audio Apps (Safari, Spotify, ...)
         |
         v
  HAL Driver (virtual audio device, Swift)
         |
    shared memory (/tmp/sotf-{uid}/audio.shm)
         |
         v
  Daemon (Rust, sotf-daemon binary)
    - reads audio via AudioDriver trait
    - runs plugin chain (EQ, upmixer, compressor, ...)
    - writes to output device via cpal
         |
         v
  Physical speakers / headphones
```

The daemon remembers the last physical output device that completed a
successful pipeline transition. On the next cold start it restores that device
before opening playback; `SOTF_OUTPUT_DEVICE` remains the explicit override.
Persisted virtual/loopback device names are ignored to preserve the no-feedback
invariant.

External processes (Swift menubar app, GPUI configbar) control the daemon over a Unix domain socket with a JSON line protocol.
Configbar mutations are serialized off the main thread; its status and
metering polls reuse a reconnecting client connection. A live daemon started by
launchd or a developer is adopted rather than killed and replaced.

The macOS installer registers daemon and Configbar as per-user LaunchAgents.
Runtime logs are `~/Library/Logs/SotF/sotf-daemon.log`,
`~/Library/Logs/SotF/sotf-systemwide.log`, and
`~/Library/Logs/SotF/sotf-systemwide.error.log`; files at least 10 MiB are
rolled to `.1` during upgrades. The final installer component starts Configbar
through the console user's launchd domain and verifies the installed executable
stays running.

Configbar device, channel, sample-rate, and buffer-size changes are submitted as
one generation-checked `apply_configuration` transaction. The daemon validates
the complete requested format and physical output before mutating HAL or the
engine, temporarily ramps active output to mute during replacement, and restores
the complete previous driver format and pipeline if the requested transition
fails.

## Crates

| Crate | Lib name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `driver-common` | `driver_common` | Platform-agnostic `AudioDriver` trait + `NullDriver` fallback |
| `driver-hal` | `driver_hal` | macOS CoreAudio HAL shared-memory bridge (encrypted via ChaCha20-Poly1305) |
| `daemon` | `sotf-daemon` | Background daemon binary; coordinates driver, engine, plugins, IPC |

### Platform support

- **macOS**: Full support via CoreAudio HAL driver (`--features hal`)
- **Linux**: Daemon and `NullDriver` fallback are supported; a native PipeWire
  filter node is planned
- **Windows**: The `driver-common` / `NullDriver` contract is portable; the
  daemon transport and native APO driver are planned
- **Fallback**: `NullDriver` compiles everywhere, reports `platform_supported: false`

Linux and Windows checks validate the existing fallback contract; they do not
imply that system audio is captured on those platforms yet.

## Building

```bash
# macOS with HAL support
cargo build -p sotf-daemon --features hal --release

# Any platform (NullDriver fallback)
cargo build -p sotf-daemon --release
```

## Running

```bash
# Start the daemon
cargo run --bin sotf-daemon --features hal --release

# The daemon listens on a Unix socket at:
#   /tmp/sotf-{uid}/daemon.sock  (secure, default)
#   /tmp/autoeq_audio.sock       (legacy, SOTF_LEGACY_SOCKET=1)
```

### Automated tests

Run the committed systemwide contract/component gates from the repository root:

```bash
just test-systemwide-macos
just test-systemwide-linux-arm64

# Run both sequentially, with macOS first.
just test-systemwide-macos-linux-arm64
```

This runs the daemon/state, real Unix-socket IPC, HAL protocol/streaming, and
Configbar model suites. The process-level scenarios start `sotf-daemon` with
`SOTF_SYSTEMWIDE_DRIVER=lab` in isolated temporary runtime directories. They
exercise coherent snapshots, 2 → 10 → 2 channel changes, transactional plugin
artifact rejection, shutdown, and restart without installing or touching the
CoreAudio HAL bundle.
The macOS gate runs the Rust HAL, shared-protocol, daemon, and real local
Unix-socket IPC tests; package-scoped strict Clippy; and Swift type-checks for
the menu-bar client and HAL driver. The Linux recipe builds a pinned test image
and runs the portable HAL streaming guards, shared-protocol tests, daemon
component/IPC tests, and package-scoped strict Clippy natively under
`linux/arm64`. Its Cargo registry, Git checkout, and target caches live in named
Docker volumes; the source tree is mounted read-only.

Neither gate installs the HAL bundle or changes the system output device. The
ignored installed-HAL tests remain a manual macOS smoke layer. Run
`just systemwide-lab` for the implemented isolated real-daemon scenarios and
HAL/Configbar simulator coverage described in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#debugging-without-installing-and-manual-testing).
Device-loss, sleep/wake, helper-resurrection, and captured-audio scenarios still
require additional simulator and installed-system evidence.

The macOS package reports its active lifecycle step in Installer. Package
script output is also retained at `/Library/Logs/SotF/installer.log`; on a
script failure, a SotF dialog offers to open that log in Console. The system
PackageKit record remains available at `/var/log/install.log`.

## Runtime safety contract

- Configbar lifecycle probes use daemon `ping`, which does not acquire engine,
  pipeline, driver, or key-manager state locks. Full status and mutation
  requests retain separate bounded deadlines; configuration parsing is
  size-bounded and off the main thread.
- Pipeline-changing IPC commands, automatic playback startup, and
  driver-initiated reconfiguration share one transition lock. Snapshot reads
  take the same lock, and Configbar renders configuration status from
  `get_snapshot`; generation-tagged UI intents are rejected if a newer
  pipeline committed before they execute.
- Daemon device enumeration and RoomEQ output-channel capability checks use a
  short-lived, generation-tagged registry, avoiding repeated synchronous CPAL
  probes during Configbar recovery polling and consecutive configuration loads.
- Daemon `engine_ready` is committed only after the physical output stream
  reports its first hardware callback. Startup failure leaves readiness false
  and enters transactional pipeline recovery.

- When HAL capture resumes after at least thirty seconds idle, the daemon
  transactionally rebuilds the currently applied physical playback stream once.
  Configbar also coalesces overlapping plugin-rack refreshes; stale-generation
  mutations refresh daemon-owned state and require an explicit retry.
- A daemon acquires process-lifetime ownership locks for its canonicalized
  control socket, HAL shared memory, HAL-readable key copy, and daemon-private
  key before construction, key rotation, or stale-socket cleanup. Distinct
  control sockets therefore cannot share and rotate one active transport.
- Runtime parents are checked for ownership and tightened to `0700` when they
  are user-owned; the explicit legacy `/tmp/autoeq_audio.sock` mode is the
  only shared-sticky-directory exception and never uses a symlink.
- SIGINT/SIGTERM performs the same shutdown path as an IPC shutdown: clear HAL
  readiness, stop the engine, close retained client sockets, join every client
  handler and the watcher, and remove only the daemon's verified Unix socket.
- Shared-memory protocol version 6 uses requested geometry plus a quiesce/ack
  handshake. Rust and Swift IO paths honor the configuring gate and preserve
  interleaved frame alignment.
- The daemon rotates the shared-audio key once per process lifetime before
  opening the transport. It atomically publishes a daemon-private copy and a
  mode-0600 HAL-readable copy because sandboxed CoreAudio cannot read the
  private path; both remain inside the same-UID trust boundary.
- Audio load requests accept only canonicalized, same-owner, non-symlink
  regular files from 1 byte through 64 GiB and verify device/inode before the
  engine opens them.
- `dump_state` reports metering and pipeline-reload request latency, response
  size, and budget-exceed telemetry for release diagnostics.
- Rust and Swift access the shared-memory header with matching acquire/release
  atomics and a tested C layout.
- CoreAudio callback staging is preallocated to the maximum supported HAL
  geometry; encrypted IO refuses to allocate on the real-time path.
- The HAL output boundary publishes readiness only after flushing and priming
  one negotiated buffer of silence. Its fixed latency contract is that target
  fill plus the Swift device latency and safety offset; failed priming leaves
  the ring empty and quiesced.
- Compile Swift with `SOTF_AUDIO_TRACE` only for explicit audio-path tracing.

## IPC protocol

JSON-over-Unix-socket, one object per line. Example:

Plugin artifacts may be linear racks or validated DAGs. Engine graph artifacts
use stable node IDs, explicit edges, channel counts, parameters, and bypass:

```json
{"command":"load_plugin_artifact","artifact":{"graph":{
  "nodes":[
    {"id":1,"plugin_type":"gain","parameters":{"gain_db":-3.0},"input_channels":2,"bypassed":false},
    {"id":2,"plugin_type":"eq","parameters":{"filters":[]},"input_channels":2,"bypassed":false}
  ],
  "edges":[{"from_node":1,"to_node":2}]
}}}
```

Graph candidates validate and apply transactionally. Configbar retains the rack
for linear topology and opens its graph editor for DAG topology.

```json
{"command": "load_plugins", "plugins": [
  {"plugin_type": "hal_input",  "parameters": {"channels": 2}},
  {"plugin_type": "eq",         "parameters": {"filters": [{"filter_type": "peak", "frequency": 1000, "q": 1.5, "gain_db": 3.0}]}},
  {"plugin_type": "hal_output", "parameters": {"channels": 2}}
]}
```
