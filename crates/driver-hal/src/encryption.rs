//! Audio encryption module for secure shared memory communication
//!
//! Provides ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption for audio data exchanged
//! between the Swift HAL driver and Rust daemon via shared memory.
//!
//! # Security Model
//!
//! - Each session generates a new 256-bit encryption key
//! - Key is stored in `~/.config/sotf/session.key` and mirrored for the HAL process
//! - Key fingerprint (first 8 bytes of SHA256) is stored in shared memory header
//! - Frame counter provides unique nonces (never reused)
//! - Poly1305 authentication tag detects tampering
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! ChaCha20-Poly1305 is chosen for:
//! - No hardware acceleration required (works on all CPUs)
//! - Excellent performance for audio-sized blocks
//! - Resistance to timing attacks
