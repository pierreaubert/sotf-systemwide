# 0.1.12 (unreleased)

## Cross-process atomic and real-time hardening

- Publish active channel geometry to the CoreAudio IO callback through a C11
  atomic snapshot, removing the callback's `configurationLock` acquisition.
- Move key-file observation and reload to HAL maintenance, and reject encrypted
  callback transport until a caller-buffer AEAD implementation can replace the
  allocating CryptoKit path.
- Gate every CoreAudio callback diagnostic behind `SOTF_AUDIO_TRACE`.
- Replace per-channel loopback cursor publication with one coherent interleaved
  SPSC ring using C11 acquire/release frame cursors.
- Publish replacement mmap generations from maintenance without waiting for
  active clients; callbacks pin their selected slot until the operation ends.
- On fresh daemon initialization, withdraw daemon readiness/heartbeat and
  quiesce/reset stale ring cursors while preserving HAL-owned readiness for
  coreaudiod-only reopen behavior.

- Add a real Swift-to-Rust concurrent reconfiguration stress test that
  alternates 2/8 channels and 48/96 kHz through the production quiesce/ack
  shared-memory protocol while Swift continuously reads frames.
- Converted the Rust/Swift shared header contract to matching atomic field
  access, using C11 acquire/release helpers from Swift.
- Added shared-header size and field-offset contract tests on both sides.
- Re-check the `configuring` gate before Swift publishes read or write
  positions, and derive Rust ring capacity from the current atomic geometry.
- Preallocate encrypted reader/writer staging for the maximum HAL geometry and
  reject insufficient capacity instead of allocating on the audio path.
- Removed mmap-layer key rotation so the daemon remains the sole key-state
  owner, and use constant-time-style fingerprint comparison in Swift.
- Gate Swift IO tracing behind `SOTF_AUDIO_TRACE` and remove wall-clock
  heartbeat updates from the Rust audio read path.
- Replaced a Rust sample/byte reinterpretation with `bytemuck` and enabled
  `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` denial for tighter unsafe auditing.

## Shared-memory security and recovery coverage (QA-SYS-001)

- Added focused non-device tests for shared-memory header integrity and
  daemon-restart behavior:
  - `SharedAudioBuffer::open` rejects corrupted headers: invalid magic, bad
    version, zero channel count, out-of-range geometry, files too small for the
    header, and files too small for the declared geometry.
  - Daemon restart with a different geometry re-initializes the header,
    resetting ring positions, ready flags, and encryption state instead of
    inheriting stale runtime data.
  - `load_initial_cipher` refuses to load a cached cipher when the on-disk key
    fingerprint does not match the shared-memory header, forcing a key reload
    after rotation.
- Default shared-memory path is verified to be user-isolated under the expected
  runtime directory (`/tmp/sotf-{uid}/audio.shm` or a lab override).

## Encrypted HAL passthrough coverage

- Added an encrypted shared-memory passthrough regression that writes and reads
  a full frame block through `SharedAudioBuffer` with `AudioCipher` and verifies
  bit-exact recovery.
- Added a source guard that the Swift HAL encryption round-trip remains part of
  the cross-language encryption test suite.

## COM lifetime and CoreAudio object notifications

- Fixed the Swift HAL COM `QueryInterface` / `AddRef` / `Release` balance so
  repeated `IUnknown` queries on the factory-provided interface no longer leak
  `gRefCount`; `QueryInterface` now only calls `AddRef` when it returns a
  distinct interface pointer.
- Property-change notifications are now gated by the CoreAudio object lifecycle.
  The HAL tracks device creation/destruction and stream discovery, then skips
  `PropertiesChanged` callbacks for invalid or undiscovered objects to avoid
  CoreAudio `HALS_PlugIn::HostInterface_PropertiesChanged: the object is not
  valid` errors.
- Added a Swift regression guard for object-lifecycle-gated property
  notifications.

Verified:
- `swiftc -typecheck crates/systemwide/crates/driver-hal/swift/Sources/*.swift`
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Volumes/home_tmp/tmp/target-sotf cargo test -p driver-hal --test streaming_regression_tests`

## HAL shared-memory ownership and streaming regressions

- The Rust HAL driver now prepares the shared-memory file from the daemon side
  with `SharedAudioBuffer::create_or_open*`, including header initialization and
  geometry validation. This lets the restricted CoreAudio HAL process open an
  already-sized mmap instead of creating or resizing files itself.
- Daemon-initiated config requests now write `requested_sample_rate` and
  `requested_buffer_frames` with `configSource=2`, wait for the HAL to
  acknowledge the request, and return an error instead of false success when no
  HAL acknowledgement arrives.
- The Swift HAL shared-memory implementation is now open-only: it no longer
  creates directories/files, truncates the mmap file, or chmods paths from
  inside coreaudiod.
- `WriteMix` no longer retries shared-memory initialization from the CoreAudio
  IO path, avoiding filesystem/mmap work in the audio callback.
- Swift now runs shared-memory retry and daemon-config polling on a private
  dispatch timer, so a HAL instance that started before the daemon-created mmap
  can still connect without doing that work on the audio thread.
- Swift now consumes daemon-initiated config requests, applies supported sample
  rate / buffer-frame changes, acknowledges the result through shared memory,
  and notifies CoreAudio of the updated format properties.
- Daemon-initiated HAL format changes now go through CoreAudio's device
  configuration-change handshake before mutating sample rate or buffer size, so
  active IO is quiesced by the host before the new format is applied.
- Swift now reports a legal fixed zero timestamp period and aligns
  `GetZeroTimeStamp()` to that period instead of using the much smaller IO
  buffer size.
- `ReadInput` no longer consumes the same shared-memory ring used by `WriteMix`
  for app-to-daemon capture; until separate daemon-to-HAL IPC exists it only
  serves loopback audio or silence.
- Added regression tests for daemon-owned shared-memory initialization,
  config-request field semantics and acknowledgement timeout, HAL reconnect
  wiring, Swift callback restrictions, Swift open-only shared memory, daemon
  config polling, and `ReadInput` capture-ring isolation.

Verified:
- `cargo test -p driver-hal`
- `swiftc -parse crates/systemwide/crates/driver-hal/swift/Sources/*.swift`
- `cargo check -p sotf-daemon -p driver-hal -p sotf-engine --features
  sotf-daemon/hal,sotf-engine/hal`
